    "*K-means* is one of the most popular clustering methods. A good initialization of *k-means* is essential for obtaining the global optimal solution and efficiency. However, there are two main obstacles with traditional *k-means* method. One is theoretical inefficiency and the other one is that its final solution is locally optimal. A better algorithm, *k-means++* addresses the second problem with an improved initialization procedure of the cluster centers. But this *k-means++* initialization is not parallelizable, because the selection for the *i*th center depends on the previous *i-1* centers [1]. Therefore, *k-means||*, a parallelizable version of *k-means++*, has been raised, which can both improve the final solution and run faster. In this report, we implemented the algorithm in the paper \"Scalable K-Means++\" in Python, compared the clustering cost and runtime between *k-means*, *k-means++* and *k-means||*, performed tests for main functions, profiled the performance of the algorithm and identified bottlenecks, and performed optimization using Cython. We then apply *k-means||* to a massive dataset to evaluate its performance.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning is to ask the computer itself to identify the underlying features of data without given specific labels of each group. It is very useful when first given a large amount of data. *K-means* is one of the most popular clustering methods. A good initialization of *K-means* is essential for obtaining the global optimal solution and efficiency. However, there are two main obstacles with traditional *K-means* method. One is theoretical inefficiency and the other one is that its final solution is locally optimal. A better algorithm, *K-means++* addresses the second problem with an improved initialization procedure of the cluster centers. But this *K-means++* initialization is not parallelizable, because the selection for the *i*th center depends on the previous *i-1* centers [1]. Therefore, *K-means||*, a parallelizable version of *K-means++*, has been raised, which can both improve the final solution and run faster. In this report, we implemented the algorithm in the paper \"Scalable K-Means++\" writen by Bahman Bahmani, Benjamin Moseley, Andrea Vattani, Ravi Kumar and Sergei Vassilvitskii in Python, compared the clustering cost and runtime between *K-means*, *K-means++* and *K-means||*, performed tests for main functions, profiled the performance of the algorithm and identified bottlenecks, and performed optimization using Cython. We then apply three kmeans methods to a simulated dataset and a real dataset to evaluate its performance."

    "### 2.1 Notation  \n",
    "Let $X = {x_1,...,x_n}$ be a set of points in the d-dimensional Euclidean space and let k be the positive integer which represents the number of clusters. Let $||x_i-x_j||$ denote the Euclidean distance between $x_i$ and $x_j$.[1] For a point x and a set $Y$, the distance is defined as $$d(x,Y) = min_{y\\in Y}||x-y||.$$ \n",
    "Let $C = {c_1,..., c_k}$ be a set of points and define the cost of Y with respect to C as \n",
    "$$\\phi_Y(C) = \\sum_{y\\in Y}d^2(y,C) = \\sum_{y\\in Y}min_{i = 1,...,k}||y-c_i||^2.$$\n",
    "We denote $C$ as the set of centers of clusters, thus a clustering of X is defines as the ith cluster is the set of all points in X that are closer to $c_i\\in C$ than any other $c_j\\in C, j \\neq i$.  \n",
    "### 2.2 K-means  \n",
    "The K-means clustering algorithm approximately minimizes within-cluster variation$$\\sum_{k=1}^K\\sum_{C(i)=k}||x_i-c_k||^2.$$ \n",

    "1. Minimize over within-cluster variation: for each i = 1, . . . n, find the cluster center $c_k$ closest to $x_i$, and let C(i) = k\n",
    "2. Minimize over $c_1,...,c_k$: for each k = 1,...K, let $c_k$ = $\\bar X_k$ ( $\\bar X_k$ is the average of the points in kth cluster).  Stop when within-cluster variation doesn’t change.  "

    "The main idea of K-means++ is to choose the centers one by one instead of choosing K centroids directly. The centroid chose before will influence the choice of next center. The algorithm is as follows:  \n",
    "**Algorithm 1** *k-means++(k)* initialization \n",

    "### 2.3.2 K-means|| initialization\n",
    "Since the inherent drawback of K-means++ is the initialization is not scalable since the choice of next center depends on the current set of centers, a parallelizable initialization, K-means||, has been raised. *k-means||* uses an oversampling factor $l = \\Omega(k)$, which is unlike *k-means++*. Intuitively, *l* should be thought of as $\\Theta$(k). This initialization algorithm picks an initial center uniformly from the dataset and computes $\\psi$, here is initial cost of the clustering of this selection. Then do log$\\psi$ iterations and in each iteration, it samples each x with probability $l*d^2(x,C)/\\psi_X(C)$ given current set $C$ of centers. If the point is sampled, it will be added to $C$ and the quantity $\\phi_X(C)$ updated and interation continued. The expected number of points chosen in each iteration is l. Since there is oversampling factor, thus the number of points in $C$ will be more than k. To reduce the number of centers, weight each point in $C$ by the number of points in $X$ whose distance to this point is shorter than it of any other point in $C$. And then recluster the weighted points to obtain k centers.  \n",
